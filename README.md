# Multi_Modal_Data_LLM

Teaching Science Book/Chapter to LLM for QA

This repository(WIP) contains a framework for extracting, structuring, and leveraging textbook content to enhance question-answering (QA) performance in a small Language Model (LLM). The project is divided into four phases: data processing, LLM evaluation, local deployment, and cloud automation.

Phase 1: Data Processing

Phase 2: Evaluating LLM Performance

Phase 3: Local Deployment and Automation

Phase 4: Cloud Deployment & Automation




Phase 1: Data Processing

Extracting and Structuring Textbook Content

The textbook is in PDF format and contains multi-modal content (text, images, tables, and equations). We use the unstructured library for efficient extraction and preprocessing.

1. Extracting Data from PDF

Use unstructured to partition and extract structured text, tables, images, and equations.

Identify different content types and store them separately for further processing.

2. Preprocessing & Structuring Data

Convert extracted content into structured formats such as JSON, Markdown, or a database.

Format tables and figures separately to ensure proper retrieval during inference.

Perform OCR on images if needed to extract embedded text.

Store textbook embeddings in a vector database for retrieval-based answering.

Phase 2: Evaluating LLM Performance

We evaluate a small LLM using three approaches:

1. Baseline - Direct Question Answering

Directly feed textbook-related questions to the LLM without additional knowledge.

Evaluate its accuracy and limitations.

2. Fine-tuning for Domain Adaptation

Convert extracted textbook content into a structured Q&A dataset.

Experiment with full fine-tuning and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning).

Measure accuracy improvements compared to the baseline.

3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

Convert textbook content into vector embeddings.

Implement similarity search to retrieve relevant textbook sections during inference.

Use LangChain or LlamaIndex to integrate the RAG pipeline.

Evaluate improvements in response accuracy.

Phase 3: Local Deployment and Automation

1. Deploy the RAG-based Q&A System Locally

Develop a framework to automate textbook ingestion for new chapters.

Host the system using local APIs or UI interfaces.

Manage experiments and versions using MLflow.

Use Docker for portability and reproducibility.

2. Build a Local Textbook Agent

Implement an agent-based system that can dynamically interact with textbook content.

Explore LangChain Agents or custom retrieval strategies.

Phase 4: Cloud Deployment & Automation

1. Migrate the Local System to the Cloud

Select a cloud provider: GCP, AWS, or Azure.

Adapt code to use cloud-native services for storage, indexing, and model hosting.

2. Automate the Workflow in the Cloud

Set up Cloud Workflows to automate textbook processing, fine-tuning, and RAG deployment.

Implement CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and updates.

Use serverless or container-based inference for scalable performance.
